# WebCrawler_Python
Hello!!
This a basic version of a web crawler in python .This one just collects all the links on a website and  stores them in a text file.
Thats it. It's prettyr simple.
This is one of my intial projects with Python and Web Crawling , so do expect flaws and do help in any way you can .

Just a note for those who wish to clone my project .. have bs4 installed to get the codde running .

Cheers to Crawling!!
